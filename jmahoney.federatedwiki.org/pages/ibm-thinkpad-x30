Approximately 1/4 - 1/3 of the screen was broken, but I could still accomplish work using the rest of the screen. My friend Michael, giver of the Ultra 5 of the [[Pile Of Free Stuff]], replaced the screen for me. I was going to help, but I had forgotten I was scheduled to be sacristan for a daily Mass at the time he came over to help. So he replaced the screen and left before I was done with my duties. The cable connecting the screen to the motherboard through the hinge has never sat properly since the replacement, but it doesn't affect anything besides cosmetics."

        "text": "At one point in my senior year, feeling profoundly stressed out, I hurled my watch at the screen of my laptop. It cracked the top right corner of the LCD. Approximately 1/4 - 1/3 of the screen was broken, but I could still accomplish work using the rest of the screen. My friend Michael, giver of the Ultra 5 of the [[Pile Of Free Stuff]], replaced the screen for me. I was going to help, but I had forgotten I was scheduled to be sacristan for a daily Mass at the time he came over to help. So he replaced the screen and left before I was done with my duties. The cable connecting the screen to the motherboard through the hinge has never sat properly since the replacement, but it doesn't affect anything besides cosmetics."
