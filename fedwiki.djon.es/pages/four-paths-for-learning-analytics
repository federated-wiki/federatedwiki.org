The session will identify, characterize, and explain the importance of four possible paths for learning analytics: \"do it to\" teachers; \"do it for\" teachers; \"do it with\" teachers; and, teachers \"DIY\". Each path will be illustrated with concrete examples of learning analytics projects from a number of universities. Each of these example projects will be analysed using the IRAC framework (Jones, Beer, & Clark, 2013) and other lenses. That analysis will be used to identify the relative strengths, weaknesses, and requirements of each of the four paths. The analysis will also be used to derive implications for the decision-makers, developers, instructional designers, and teachers that make up the Moodle community."
