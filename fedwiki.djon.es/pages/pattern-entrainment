Think about a long drive; most of the time you are barely aware of the process but then something happens ahead and you suddenly become aware in a material way.</blockquote>\n"

But if we are dealing with emerging patterns, then the patterns we know can actually blind us and prevent us from \"seeing\" the new patterns. We also have a strong tendency to attribute \"cause\" where is may not exist: a variant of the fundamental attribution error. This phenomenon is rife throughout the great surprise in history. We refer to this phenomenon as <em>pattern entrainment</em>.....To avoid pattern entrainment, we need to \"<em>anticipate</em>\" new patterns to enable us to \"see\" those patterns as they emerge and to understand the key changes of the situation which will almost certainly also require a way to disrupt the pattern entrainment of intelligence analysts.</blockquote>"
