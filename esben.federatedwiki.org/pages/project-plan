Shogun automatically generates interfaces to a range of different programming languages making it usable in most programming environments. The automatic interface generation is convenient for users and makes the codebase more maintainable (i.e. developers don’t have to update every interface manually when the core implementation changes). Still, the interface generation leaves one problem unsolved - the documentation of the code needs to be maintained across multiple languages.

Furthermore, if examples are outdated for one of the target languages, then any errors or bugs that may have been introduced with some new API change will not be discovered for that target language.
