Categories (and to some extent, the first web notions of tagging) were built using the \"What links here?\" functionality. The recent changes stream (again, a predecessor to the social streams you see everyday now) was constructed off of file write dates. Profile signatures were page links, and were even used to construct a rudimentary messaging system."}]
