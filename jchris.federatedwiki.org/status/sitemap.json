If there is someone else, please point me in their direction.\n\nRead these comments and think about me thinking about how to put your name in lights. And nothing you do on those particular grates is gonna save you.\n\n\nJim Otterson August 5, 2015 at 9:47 pm\nODOT: Put some hot melt loop sealant in the longitudinal crack – takes 10 minutes, MAX, problem solved. Raise the drain inlet grate on the other location, and add a grate with transverse bars, then add asphalt to raise the surrounding grade: Time to complete – one evening shift. Dollars spent, not much. Dollars saved from lawsuit by injured cyclist/dead cyclist: Incalculable, but definitely NOT cheap. I’m a civil engineer with 34 years experience in the highway and traffic industry, this is easy guys. Get with the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nac August 5, 2015 at 3:54 pm\nThere were crews there most of last winter dealing with the bridge guard rail extensions.\n\nThey had traffic control there for MONTHS — the grates could have been simply dealt with then, no?\n\n\n\nBike Manufacturer August 5, 2015 at 2:20 pm\nWe have been complaining about the grates, grooved gutter, and narrow lane since before 2000, with ZERO positive response. The street has been completely re-paved and stripped at least twice since we started complaining with no improvements to the road for cyclists. We now use the side street route pioneered by Portland skateboarders in the 60’s as an alternative. Taylor’s Ferry Rd./2nd/Ruby Tr. or 5th/5th/ Terwilliger. Ruby Terrace is very rough for bikes.\n\n\nhttp://bikeportland.org/2015/08/05/man-adds-warning-paint-sunken-grate-state-roads-agency-calls-vandalism-154842#comment-6493613"}]
